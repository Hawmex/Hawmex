## About Me

I am pursuing my graduate studies in Systems Modeling & Data Analytics at Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), where my academic focus converges on machine learning, applied statistics, and optimization methodologies. My commitment to advancing my expertise in these domains has led me to complete several specialized courses in machine learning, deep learning, and large language models through Stanford University and DeepLearning.AI's comprehensive programs on Coursera. Concurrently, I have been actively engaged in various university research initiatives, applying theoretical knowledge to practical implementations.

My technical journey began with web development, mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript during my formative years, which later evolved into proficiency in TypeScript and Dart for cross-platform development. This foundation in programming, coupled with my current focus on machine learning, has enabled me to develop extensive expertise in Python and its ecosystem, which I leverage extensively in my academic research and project implementations.
